/*
Data Types in C++
C++ is a statically typed language, meaning you must specify the type of every variable at compile time. This ensures type safety and better performance, but it also means the compiler will throw errors if you try to assign incompatible types.

Primitive Types:
int for integers (whole numbers).
float and double for decimal values, with double providing more precision.
char for single characters.
bool for Boolean values (true or false).

Derived Types:
Arrays, pointers, references, and function types fall under this.

User-defined Types:
Structures (struct), classes (class), and enumerations (enum).


C++ also supports modifiers like unsigned, short, and long to tweak the size and range of numeric types. For example, unsigned int only stores non-negative integers but allows larger maximum values than a signed int.
